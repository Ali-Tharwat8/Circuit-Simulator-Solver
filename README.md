## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

- Simulate DC circuits (resistors, voltage sources)  
- Support basic reactive elements (capacitors, inductors)  
- Solve circuits via nodal or mesh analysis  
- Compute currents, voltages, and power consumption  
- Frequency domain analysis (AC circuits)  
- Parse circuit definitions from file or interactive input  
- Modular architecture allowing extension for more component types  

---

## üõ† Requirements & Dependencies

- C++11 or newer (or whichever language the project uses)  
- Standard libraries (math, i/o, vectors, etc.)  
- (Optional) Linear algebra / matrix library (if used internally)  
- No heavy external dependencies assumed ‚Äî mostly standard language features
